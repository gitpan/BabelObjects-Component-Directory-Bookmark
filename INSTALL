Installation

CPAN
----

BabelObjects may be installed through the CPAN shell in the usual CPAN shell
manner.  It typically is:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install BabelObjects::Component::Directory::Bookmark'

It involves a little more work if you have an older CPAN shell:

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  install BabelObjects::Component::Directory::Bookmark

Getting The Latest Version
--------------------------

BabelObjects can also be installed manually. Tarballs are available from
several sources:

The most recent stable release can be found at your favorite CPAN
mirror.  If you don't have a favorite CPAN mirror, there's always:

  ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/K/KE/KERMAGO/

The most recent development snapshot is available from :

  http://www.BabelObjects.org/

The BabelObjects project includes a CVS repository browser, so you can
look around to see what's new.  It also has facilities for people to
submit bug reports, patches, and support requests.

On BabelObjects, you will find this same project in Java and Php (so
you understand now the name Babel Objects :-). If you are brave, come
and develop the framework in a new language.

---------------------------
Building The Latest Version

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as an exercise for
the reader.  See the previous section for tarball locations.
