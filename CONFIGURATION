Prerequisites
-------------

Bookmarks you want to visit must be stored in the following structure :

$ROAMING_DIR/user1/bookmarks
$ROAMING_DIR/user2/bookmarks

where $ROAMING_DIR is the directory where you want to store the bookmarks.

This structure is used as well by the mod_roaming module you can install. It's
not needed for the BOC-Directory-Bookmark component to run, but it makes
the whole much powerful. Mod_roaming permits to use the Netscape roaming
feature : preferences, bookmarks, ... can be stored on a browser. It makes
your life easier if you are nomad.

-------------
Configuration
-------------

  1. Update the $ROAMING_DIR variable in Bookmark.pm to suit you need.
     /home/roaming is a good choice.

  2. Add in the classes.xml file in BabelObjects configuration directory the
     name of the class to call the BOC-Directory-Component :

     <classes>
      <parameter>
         <bookmark>BabelObjects::Component::Directory::Bookmark</bookmark>
      </parameter>
     </classes>

-----
Start
-----

Start the httpd server. With Apache, type :

  root # apachectl start

----
Test
----

To test the installation, copy sample/test_bookmark.bo in your html space.
Go and visit it with the parameters corresponding to the user you create.
For example, http://yourserver/test_bookmark.bo?user=user1 for the bookmark
stored under $ROAMING_DIR/user1/bookmarks
 
Enjoy !
